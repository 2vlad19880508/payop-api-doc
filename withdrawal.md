### Mass withdrawal requests

Endpoint: https://payop.com/v1/withdrawals/create-mass

You can create multiple withdrawal requests at the same time. The procedure is very similar to the previous one. You should use a slightly different endpoint and put several data sets to create queries in one array.

```json
[
    {
        "method": 8,
        "type": 1,
        "amount": 34,
        "currency":"USD",
        "additionalData": {
            "direction": "direction one",
            "email": "my.email@address.com"
        }
    },
    {
        "method": 6,
        "type": 1,
        "amount": 35,
        "currency":"USD",
        "additionalData": {
            "direction": "direction two",
            "walletNumber": "my wallet number",
